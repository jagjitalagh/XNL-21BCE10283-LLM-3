pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
Steps in the Notebook
Data Loading: Reads the dataset using pandas.
Preprocessing: Handles missing values, feature scaling, and data balancing (if applicable).
Model Selection: Uses LogisticRegression for classification.
Training & Evaluation: Splits data, trains the model, and evaluates performance using accuracy score.
Running the Notebook
